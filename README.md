# Work

## Current

I’m a senior software consultant at [TNG Technology Consulting GmbH][tng] in
Munich, Germany. Our core business model is sending groups of young, smart and
enthusiastic programmers on client projects that typically last for multiple
years, with individuals switching projects every 1-2 years.

To keep employees happy and passionate, we spend a huge amount of money on
education. I get to fly on conferences for free as much as I want, every other
Friday we’re allowed to pretty much do whatever we want as long as it’s vaguely
technology related (playing foosball is not considered work, but sticking a
camera and motors to a foosball table and writing an AI for automating it is),
and pretty much everything under 250€ is ordered without questioning or delay.
I’ve racked up (and read) quite a few books because of that.

Overtime is fully compensated, I have 31.5 days off per year, I work around 41
hours a week (contract demands 40), holidays carry over to the next year, and I
can live a comfortable live with my salary.

## Education: Physics

I’m a physicist by education, which I studied at the University of
Würzburg/Germany (where Röntgen, the first Nobel lauretate) is from, and at
Rutgers/USA, where I spent a year abroad.

My Bachelor thesis was in experimental photoelectron spectroscopy (application:
thin film solar cells) because I wanted to work with big, impressive, and loud
machines before going into pen-and-paper theory. I followed that plan, and took
a detour to general relativity and high energy particle physics, before doing a
master thesis on non-equilibrium thermodynamics, where I studied spontaneous
decreases of entropy, and entropy production in nonequilibrium systems.

On my way, I developed an interest in pure mathematics, in particular in the
field of differential geometry at the time. There interest is still there, but
the mathematical domain has shifted a great amount to logic and type theory.

## No formal education: Programming and computer science

I have no formal education in dealing with computers, programming and what have
you. What I do have is a keen interest in it since around age 14, which lead me
to self-teach me a lot over the years. More about this can be found in the
»hobbies« section.



# Hobbies

## Programming

### Haskell

I’m an expert in [Haskell][haskell.org], a purely functional programming
language. I attained my knowledge from what I like to call IRC osmosis,
attending and speaking at conferences, reading lots of papers, writing lots of
code for fun, participating on the mailing lists, and organizing user groups.

My arguably biggest achievements in Haskell are [changing a core part of the
standard library][amp], and then [doing it again on a related, but different
topic][mfp].

I’ve implemented [an interpreter for the lowest level intermediate
representation most commonly in use][stgi] for fun and learning. I think
compilers are the most interesting programs to write, because a lot of different
problems from different domains of computer science intersect in their creation.
I’ve found many of the attained skills immensely useful in other domains, and
even other programming languages.

### Programming languages

I have seen many different programming languages, used some of them, and a few
extensively.

I think **Haskell** is the best language for developing everyday
industrial-grade software, because I don’t have to think as much writing in it,
allowing me to focus on the task at hand instead of battling with the language
itself. Its support for refactoring even complex and poorly understood codebases
is unparalleled, and I’ve seen nothing remotely close to it in any other
language. I think Haskell has domains it’s poorly suited for by design and wish
people would not try to make it work in those areas.

I think **PHP**, which I have used extensively, is an intellectual insult, and I
have great disrespect for anyone evangelizing it.

I find the idea of failing fast and hard behind **Erlang/Elixir** very
interesting, and would like to learn more about it.

I think **Rust** is an upgrade to the mess that **C++** is (the latter I’ve also
used a lot), but unfortunately its type system is a huge price to pay.
Syntax-wise it’s atrocious, but I’ve gotten used to C++ at one point, so I’m
sure I’d be able to get used to Rust as well. It does combine many compelling
features, so I’ve given it a couple of (superficial) shots already.

I don’t really have an opinion about **Javascript**; given the original design
goals, it’s a remarkably good language. The idea behind Node.js’ asynchronicity
using callbacks (on the program level) is completely idiotic. The syntax is
average (i.e. bad), but I found Coffeescript to be a very much readable dialect,
although it hinders debugging a great amount.

**Mathematica** is an amazing tool for data science (and a terrible programming
language). It’s really a shame it’s closed source and proprietary, but it would
probably be unsustainable as a community-driven effort, considering the crazy
amount of time that goes into aggregating its vast and pretty coherent API and
data sources. I’ve been one of the people who bootstrapped
[mathematica.stackexchange.org][mathematica.stackexchange] during my studies,
back then (and until this day) the best help resource for the program.

### Computer science

I’m interested in type theory, and a proponent of strong static types. I’m
familiar with advanced languages like Agda, and I’ve read many books on the
theory behind such languages. Their domains range from immediately practical to
what people in ivory towers would consier ivory towery.

I have a fairly broad, but not very deep knowledge of data structures and
algorithms. Most things I know by heart are from the functional domain, i.e.
persistent and typically amortized applications.

Although I’m interested in hardware and low-level programming, I could never
bring myself to do anything serious in that domain. I don’t know much about CPUs
beyond what one could build in Minecraft.

Sparked by advanced Haskell, I learned about category theory, and was utterly
disappointed by the return on investment. There that are equally challenging to
me, but much more fruitful both in terms of practice and follow-up ideas enabled
by it. The only thing understanding a monad from the math perspective taught me
is respect for those who recognized their practical relevance around 25 years
ago.

### Programming style

I take great pride in both pragmatism and elegance in my code. Pragmatism for me
is not »getting shit done«, which typically comes down to »getting *shit* done«,
but developing an well-understood and extensible solution to a particular
problem. Well-understood so that I am confident my solution is actually a
solution, and extensible so that instead of having to overengineer the code for
all possible scenarios, I can be confident that I can adapt to them reasonably
well, should the need arise. It does not mean cutting corners to save time,
using the debugger to insert special cases, or hoping the QA will find whatever
I forgot thinking about. Working in the latter mode on a regular basis causes me
great discomfort, and I believe it’s a very short-sighted and much more
expensive development process than doing it right from the beginning. If
business requires it, I am willing and capable to write atrocious hacks, but I
will insist in doing them right when time isn’t of the essence anymore.

I have never seen code that both was and was called »self-documenting«. I think
code should consist of excellent code with good documentation and tasteful use
of types.

Everything Robert C. Martin makes me angry. I’ll spare you the rant.



## Philosophy

I’m whatever the »I’m interested in science« analogon in philosophy kind of
person is. I’m insterested in epistemology due to its connection to physics and
logic, and ethics and morale due to its connection to everyday reality. I have
not read many original texts, but lots of secondary works, mostly online. I
think [Existential Comics][existentialcomics] is an amazing resource for
appetizers to read up on.



## Sports

### Bouldering

I like bouldering because it’s a very social individual sport, which gives me
the best of all worlds: my achievements are solely based on my own abilities,
but they are very easily shared and best enjoyed with like-minded people. Thanks
to rock gyms, bouldering can be done with little time investment and at any time
of the day and year. Bouldering outside typically involves camping with little
luxury and interesting and ambitious people.

Since I’ve long been on a personal plateau of projects in the Fb 7a/b difficulty
range, I’ve recently started exercising. My goals are muscle up on rings, front
lever on rings, handstand on solid ground, and finger strengh by hanging on the
finger board a lot. These are just (symptoms of a) means to an end though, my
open projects are Grit Deluxe (Magic Wood 7b), Supernova (Magic Wood 7c),
Graviton (Fontainbleau 7a), and Rainbow Rocket (Fontainbleau 8a).

### Gymnastics

I’ve started doing gymnastics again, which I haven’t done for six years. Some
skills are still there, most are gone. Still, I enjoy the trampoline, and am
having great fun exercising on rings, which are probably the most versatile
training tool in general, and certainly the one with the most bang for the buck.

### Mountain biking

My mountain bike hasn’t seen much use for a lack of time in the last years, but
I have fond memories of cycling two horizons a day in the Alps, far away from
civilization, and seeing landscapes inaccessible to hikers (because of the
boring distance to cover before reaching the nice spot) and cars.

### Not swimming

I don’t like swimming, but I do have a rule that when I’m at the sea or the
ocean I have to go in. I’ve stress-tested this rule on the Atlantic in March. I
regretted it, but not enough to abolish the rule.



## Other

Recurring interests of mine are typically things we have around us a lot, yet
mostly go unnoticed.

Typography is a domain of beautiful detail and rich history, but most people
don’t know about it, and fewer yet appreciate it.

Photography is similarly becoming a niche activity, since phone cameras
commoditized taking pictures so much that it’s become difficult to justify
walking around aimlessly looking for a good picture, much like I would find it a
strange hobby if someone would just like to take the bus without really wanting
to reach a destination. For me it’s a very lonely hobby since I can’t stand
taking pictures when there are people around. I don’t think I’m very good at it
either, but I occasionally enjoy it nonetheless.
